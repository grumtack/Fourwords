# Fourwords
Python usfm cypher script   
     
Fourwords takes a folder of usfm files and replaces each word with a unique but arbitrary four-letter nonsense word saving to a new folder and creating a lexicon of word mappings in the same folder.  
  
Usage:

You can choose any letters you want to be used in your 4 letter words.
